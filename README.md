# C++ Solutions to Niuke Problems

Welcome to the repository containing my C++ solutions to problems from Niuke. This repository is a collection of solutions categorized by difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each directory corresponds to a specific problem from Niuke, providing a detailed C++ implementation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the difficulty of the problems. Each directory contains subdirectories for individual problems. Each problem's subdirectory contains:

- `README.md`: A brief description of the problem.
- `main.cpp`: The C++ solution to the problem.
- `input.txt` (optional): Sample input files for testing.
- `output.txt` (optional): Expected output files for testing.

Here is a basic structure of the repository:

```

├── Easy
│   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── main.cpp
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   └── output.txt
